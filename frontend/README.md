# AeroGenie - Frontend

This is the frontend of the EduCompanio project. It is a React application that uses the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library for styling.

## Requirements

- Node 18.0.0 or later (see [checking the Node version](#checking-the-nodejs-version))

## Checking the Node.js version

To check which Node version you have, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If the command doesn't return a version, you might not have Node installed.

You can go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and set up Node (`v18.0.0` or later) on your machine. If you use a version manager for Node, use it to install Node 18.

Once you install node, run `node -v` again to confirm the version. You might need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

## Running the frontend locally

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install the Node dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Confirm that a backend is running

4. Start the frontend client.

```bash
npm run dev
```
